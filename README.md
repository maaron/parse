Parser Library
==============

This is a parser combinator library, drawing inspiration from other libraries  
such as [Boost.Spirit](http://boost-spirit.com) and [Parseq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Parseq).  It consists of a number of simple parsers  
and parser combinators that can be composed into arbitrarily complex parsers.  
For usage examples, take a look at the unit tests.
